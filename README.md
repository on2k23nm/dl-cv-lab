# DL-CV Lab

An open notebook of my journey in Deep Learning & Computer Vision.

I use this space to:
- Explore DL/CV ideas through small, honest experiments
- Re-implement concepts in my own code instead of copy-pasting
- Build practical vision mini-projects and utilities over time

Most work lives in simple notebooks and scripts, updated as I learn.
Tools: C++17, Python, PyTorch, Torchvision, Jupyter / VS Code.

Feel free to read, run, or adapt anything that’s useful.
